Hey so when Iâ€™m a tric their is these black 1 second boxes I think from the stampede ability and it takes over the bottom of your screen.
for forager it says faster food drain but water drains faster as well.
Alio has a glitch to where when you pick up a trophy sometimes it disappears in your mouth but still says you can turn it in and it allows you to eat and fight and you still get the trophy delivery.
